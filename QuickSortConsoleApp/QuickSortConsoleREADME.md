# Quick Sort Console application
This will be the demonstration of the Quick Sort console appilcation
## CSVMainipulator class
This is the process that deals with reading CSV int values that filters through what is actually a int value and everything else.

All you need to have the class perform as intended is to put your csv file into the folder and change the name of the FiletoCall variable to the name of the file itself and the new file will be called NewFile.csv.

## QuickSorter class
This is the main class where the main intent of the project is at where the goal is to sort a collection of int values from lowest to highest regardless of how many other values get added.

You can try for yourself because in my repo I added a small collection and a 10000 count collection ready to be done with swift efficiency.
