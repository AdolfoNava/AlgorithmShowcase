# Data Structures Demonstration
This is for the differences I found for these two comparisons 

## Array Vs. Maps(Dictionary)
### Differences between Array Vs. Maps
Arrays are intended for precised collection of objects with easy access to change and observe the individual variables with ease

Maps are for dynamic solutions with added distinction from other indexed variables within the collection without being able to maintain order of the collection
### My personal decision between the two
My perference I like arrays more because it has easy to understand system to utilize the collection properly with the same base mechanic of reading and writing in variables

## Stack Vs. Queue 
### Differences between Stacks Vs. Queues
Stacks are lists with restricted access to the earliest objects inserted into the collection with the intent to deal wtih the most recent objects inserted before anything else

Queues are lists with the intent to gather new elements to be dealt with by whichever was inserted first rather than the most recent variable added
### My personal decision between the two
For Games (which is what I mainly do) I think that queues is better because the queue would be involved with online solutions with internet packets collected and sent out and stacks will make the experience less responsive.
