# AlgorithmShowcase
This is my collection of various demonstrations of algorithm systems as well my explantions as to what I have been working on. All algorithm demonstrations are in c# only and will be expanded based on what I was taught. All naming conventions in the repository will be clear and exact as to what I am doing in my comments as well as the methods variable names is concerned.

Example: 
```csharp
//Constant in this example means that it'll only perform the action a pre designed amount of times and therefore
//can not be used for scalable databases or searching for stored variables in a collection because it requires manual 
//adjustment each time

      void ConstantBigOExample(int[] example)
          {
                Console.WriteLine("Constant BigO example 'O1':");
          //Here the method will only run once and only for the first object in the array

                Console.WriteLine(example[0]);
          //output: 0
          }     
```
