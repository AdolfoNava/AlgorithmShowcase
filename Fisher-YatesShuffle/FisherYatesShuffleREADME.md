# Fisher-Yates Shuffle 
This will be a demo for the Fisher-Yates shuffle Algorithm
## FileReader class
The FileReader class functions incredibly similar to the previous Quick Sort CSVManipulator class where the intent is to read and write txt instead of csv file extensions.

Words are only separated by the space bar and do not remove any extra characters like ",',,,.,`,~, etc.
## Swapper class
This class only has one purpose and that is to swap elements of the array around the collection.
## MyExtensions class
The class only has one purpose and that is to calculate the amount of words in the txt files.
## FYShuffle class
The FYShuffle class is the main function of the program where the collection gets shuffled Fisher-Yates style.
