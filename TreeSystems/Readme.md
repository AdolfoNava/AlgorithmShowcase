# BinaryTreeSystem
This is my understanding of algorithms using tree structures in C#. This is using the Binary Tree System as the basis for my demonstration of my knowledge of how this particular structure works as a whole
## The process
The process works by creating a root of basis of the collection that every other data point refers to as the tree gets bigger. The tree structure is done automatically as the application makes frequent calls to the insert method which is recurvise to be consistent so long as the data is int values.
## Displaying Results
The results can get displayed in different ways depending no the order of the methods displaying the results and that is in this app only three ways which are:

- InOrderRec

- PreOrderRec

- PostOrderRec

These ways of visualizing the results
